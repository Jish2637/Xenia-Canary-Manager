I have created a save/game manager for Xenia Canary.

**Features:**

_Auto launch games - No need to press F9!_

_Separate  configs per game._

_Easy Config Management, add, edit and remove custom game configurations with ease._

_Easy Save Backup & Restore._

_Easy to use update system - updates xenia directly from the official xenia canary github_

The app allows you to create separate configurations for each game you are emulating.

On first launch it will ask you if you would like to download the latest Xenia App and Game Patches.

You just need to copy your cache and content folders into SaveData & the app will manage the rest for you.

Auto launch will only work once you have opened a game at least once using the app. (It attempts to press F9 after starting Xenia - Configurable via games_config.json)

Version 2.3 of my save/game manager tool.

Created for personal use primarily.
